### 🚀 About Me

- 💻 CS student with a low-level mind and high-level questions  
- 🐍 Python-heavy, but C++ is my current curiosity sink  
- 🛠️ Comfortable across frontend/backend/data when it's held together with duct tape and discipline  
- 🌐 System-level thinker: from bitwise to browser, I want to know how and why it ticks  
- 🧩 My idea of fun is wrestling an algorithm for 3 days because the brute-force “works” and that bothers me
