### 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 CS student with a habit of overanalyzing problems (on purpose)  
- 🧠 I care about the "why" behind the solution—not just the "how"  
- 🐍 Python developer who enjoys low-level control (hello C++)  
- 🔧 Invested in bridging theory and practice across code, systems, and architecture  
- 🧪 Always experimenting—be it algorithms, tooling, or clean abstractions
